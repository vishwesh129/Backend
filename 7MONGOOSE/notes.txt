to have a connection between the Database(MongoDB) and our server(Node and Express)

ORM's/Driver

1. MongoDB client
2. Mongoose
3. Sequelize (to connect to MySQL)
4. Prisma


Mongoose : 
1. helps us to connect the server <--> Database
2. Define the structure of the document
3. It also helps us with validation (UI level, API level, on the Database level)



Different Models for Different collections/entities

Inside details of a Model -> blueprint/schema


Let us connect our Database using mongoose 



1) connecting - done - mongoose.connect

2) creating the structure/models - mongoose.model
    a) The Model name's first letter will always be capital
       like constructor function, class, model
    b) __v - versionKey - keeps track of the version

3) Validation
        a) Typecasting -> type - number, string, casting - changing/manipulating/trying to fit in

        "23" -> Typecasted to a Number? -> Yes
        "abc" -> Typecasted to a Number? -> No
         56 -> Typecasted to a String? -> Yes

        default
        enum
