Why Express ? 
1 - It's easier, clean code
2 - It has a rich ecosystem of middlewares


Middleware?

It's just a function, which runs between the request and response
It has access to the request object,response object and has a "next" function

Order does matter - runs on all routes below the mw

Even when we have multiple mw - order matters


--- 3 types of middlewares ---

1. Custom Middleware - where we write our own logic - eg : logger
2. Express Inbuilt middlewares - where we use express's middlewares -
     eg : express.json(), 
          express.text()
          Router() Middleware
3. Community/external middlewares -  multer, morgan, cors
